Deitels cpp HugeInteger class solution

A machine with 32-bit integers can represent integers in the range of approximately 2 billion to +2 billion. This fixed- size restriction is rarely troublesome, but there are applications in which we would like to be able to use a much wider range of integers. Class  HugeInt was built to create more powerful data types. It has the overload multiplication, division and relational and equality operators.
